# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) Project

## Overview
This project aims to perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a given dataset to uncover patterns, trends, and insights that can inform data-driven decision-making. 
The EDA process involves data cleaning, preprocessing, visualization, and statistical analysis.

## Objectives
- To understand the distribution and structure of the data
- To identify any anomalies or outliers
- To explore relationships and correlations between variables
- To generate insights and actionable recommendations based on the analysis

## Project Structure
The project is organized into the following sections:
1. **Introduction**: Overview of the dataset and the objectives of the analysis
2. **Data Cleaning and Preprocessing**: Steps taken to clean and preprocess the data
3. **Data Visualization**: Visual representations of the data to identify patterns and trends
4. **Statistical Analysis**: Statistical methods used to analyze the data
5. **Insights and Conclusions**: Key findings and recommendations based on the analysis

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
